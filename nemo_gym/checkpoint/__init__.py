"""Checkpoint control plane shared by every Gym server.

Partial rollout checkpointing pauses, drains, commits, and restores Gym
servers in lockstep with the NeMo-RL training checkpoint. The pieces in this
package are the server-side mechanisms that make those control calls safe:

- ``control``: the ``/ng-control/v1`` capability declaration, checkpoint-id
  fencing, phase machine, and deadline plumbing every control route uses.
