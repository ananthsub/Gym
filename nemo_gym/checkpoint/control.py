"""Shared control-plane infrastructure for checkpoint coordination.

Every Gym server exposes ``GET /ng-control/v1/capabilities`` so the NeMo-RL
NemoGym actor can discover, before any checkpoint starts, what each server
supports: its component kind, admission states, checkpoint mode, schema
version, concurrency contract, and multi-process mode. A required capability
that is missing fails setup on the actor side instead of failing the first
checkpoint at its deadline.

Control routes added by later features (admission pause/resume, checkpoint
commit/restore) share one fencing discipline, implemented here by
``ControlFence``:

- Every control call carries a ``checkpoint_id`` and an absolute deadline.
- A retried call with the same checkpoint id and operation returns the first
  call's recorded result instead of running the operation again.
- A call whose checkpoint id was already committed or aborted is rejected
  with ``409 stale_checkpoint``; a call for a different checkpoint while one
  is active is rejected with ``409 checkpoint_conflict``.
- An operation arriving in a phase it is not legal in is rejected with
  ``409 invalid_phase``.
